                A primary focus of the iGEM competition is the 
                ability of teams from around the world, communicating and collaborating to 
                accomplish a common goal: developing the field of synthetic 
                biology and improving the Earth as a whole. Since its genesis, Stony Brook iGEM has
                been committed to creating unique collaborations with other teams.
                To start off the summer, we made our own TikTok challenge, providing other
                teams with data fir their experiemnts, and blah blah blah. In total, Stony Brook
                iGEM has collaborated with over 50 iGEM teams from around the world. Every collaboration
                has had a significant impact on our ideals, experiments and development as
                a team. The connections we've fostered will not only aid the team's future endeavors,
                but add to the field of science as a whole.
